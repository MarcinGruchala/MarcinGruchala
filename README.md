# Hello 👋

## About me 👀

I'm a software developer with a strong foundation in mobile (Android/Flutter) 
who evolved into AI Engineering and backend development. 
These days I focus on building RAG systems, conversational agents, 
and LLM-based workflows using Python/FastAPI — mostly in R&D environments 
where rapid prototyping and quick validation matter most.
