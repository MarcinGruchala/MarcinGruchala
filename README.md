# Hello 👋

## About me 👀

I'm a software developer and generalist — I started in mobile (Android/Flutter), 
but these days I focus on building solutions regardless of the technology. 
My main areas are AI Engineering (RAG systems, conversational agents, LLM-based workflows), 
backend development (Python/FastAPI), and rapid prototyping in R&D environments.
